TTRTS Gameplay
=================

The game takes place in a series of simultaneous turns on an arbitrarily sized 2D board.

Each player is in control of a set number of starting units, and each turn receives data on the status of the board.

Each player must then issue a command to each unit in their control.

All commands are evaluated simultaniously.

All attempted movement to the same square by two or more units will fail.

Friendly fire is enabled by default.

A player wins when all opposing units have been destroyed.
