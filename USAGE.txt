NAME
	ttrts - Tiny Terminal RTS

SYNOPSYS
	ttrts [OPTIONS...] MAPFILE

DESCRIPTION
	ttrts is a tiny terminal based RTS where that uses text files as order lists to control it's units.

	This means that any user, program or cat that can read and write to text files can play the game.

USAGE
	When invoked, ttrts will set up a full game and output a single file representing the current gamestate into a local directory called ttrts_{GAME_NAME}.

	This file can be read in and interpretted by human, robot, or cat.
	ttrts will wait for orders files to be placed in it's current working directory.

	File name formats:
	  gamestate   Turn_{TURN_NUMBER}.txt
	  orders      Turn_{TURN_NUMBER}_Team_{TEAM_NUMBER}.txt

	Once orders have been set for each player taking part, ttrts consumes order files,
	calculates new game state and outputs a new file.

	This process repeats until a winner is chosen!
