Any programming language than can handle file I/O can be used to make an AI for TTRTS, and this extensibility allows for any type of programmer to enjoy designing and playing against their friends.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Building TTRTS\r\n\r\n#### Requirements\r\n* CMake - our build system uses cmake\r\n* Linux/OSX - currently no support for Windows, tracked with [Issue #9](https://github.com/mdiluz/ttrts/issues/9)\r\n* perl 5.0 or newer - for the launch script\r\n\r\n#### To Build\r\n    $ git clone https://github.com/mdiluz/ttrts.git\r\n    $ cd ttrts\r\n    $ ./bootstrap.sh\r\n    $ man ttrts # for full usage and guide\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Development\r\n\r\n* master branch always stores latest stable release\r\n* master/{hotfix} branches store in progress hotfixes for the stable branch\r\n* dev branch stores in progress development\r\n* dev/{feature} branches store features\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Changelog\r\n\r\n#### v0.4.0\r\n* Updated with network functionality\r\n  * Game can now be hosted with ttrts --server option\r\n  * Server can be connected to with ttrts --client\r\n* Updated command line interface with new launcher script\r\n  * map file must now be specified with --map=FILE \r\n* Slight refactor of libraries to account for new run targets\r\n\r\n#### v0.3.2\r\n* Fix bug when loading map files with walls\r\n* Fix ttrts on OSX\r\n  * Install man files to correct location\r\n  * Update usage of sed to be compatible with BSD as well as GNU versions\r\n* New maps and renames of old ones\r\n\r\n#### v0.3.1\r\n* Upgraded install target to repository\r\n  * libttrts static library binary in /usr/local/lib\r\n  * ttrts headers in /usr/local/include/ttrts\r\n  * bash completion into /etc/bash_completion.d/\r\n  * man page into /usr/local/man/man6\r\n  * maps into /usr/share/ttrts/maps\r\n* client now supports env variable configuration\r\n  * TTRTS_MAPS for location of map files, defaults to /usr/share/ttrts/maps\r\n  * TTRTS_GAMES for gameplay directories, defaults to /tmp/\r\n* Map files now have proper header\r\n* NOTE: This version is compatible with v0.3.0, but old generated mapfiles will need the additional header line added\r\n\r\n#### v0.3.0\r\n* Additional functionality of walls\r\n  * Walls are noted in gamestate file on new \"WALL:[X,Y]...\" line\r\n  * Walls are impassable by all movement\r\n* Units leave an impassable wall behind after movement\r\n* Game can now end if no units are able to move\r\n* Various C++ api simplifications\r\n* Integration of perl api from [ttrts-players](https://github.com/mdiluz/ttrts-players)\r\n\r\n#### v0.2.0 \r\n* All team references changed to player\r\n    * Order file format changed to Player_#_Turn_#.txt\r\n    * Unit descriptors now use pl: instead of tm:\r\n* Various other C++ api corrections and refactors\r\n\r\n#### v0.1.0 \r\n* First playable version of ttrts\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n## Further Information\r\n\r\nSee the ttrts [README](source/README.md) for full usage and game rules\r\n\r\nSee [ttrts-players](https://github.com/mdiluz/ttrts-players) for examples of AIs\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
